### Readability Scores

Vale calculates several standard readability indices:

<ParamField path="automated_readability_index" type="number">
  **Automated Readability Index (ARI)**
  
  Estimates the U.S. grade level needed to comprehend the text. Based on characters per word and words per sentence.
  
  - Lower scores (1-5): Elementary school
  - Middle scores (6-10): Middle/high school
  - Higher scores (11+): College level
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="coleman_liau_index" type="number">
  **Coleman-Liau Index**
  
  Estimates U.S. grade level using character count instead of syllables.
  
  - Score of 8: Eighth grade reading level
  - Score of 12: High school senior reading level
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="flesch_kincaid_grade_level" type="number">
  **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**
  
  Translates the Flesch Reading Ease score into a U.S. school grade level.
  
  - Score of 6: Sixth grade level
  - Score of 10: Tenth grade level
  - Score of 13+: College level
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="flesch_reading_ease" type="number">
  **Flesch Reading Ease**
  
  Rates text on a 100-point scale. Higher scores indicate easier readability.
  
  - 90-100: Very easy (5th grade)
  - 60-70: Standard (8th-9th grade)
  - 30-50: Difficult (College level)
  - 0-30: Very difficult (College graduate)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="gunning_fog" type="number">
  **Gunning Fog Index**
  
  Estimates years of formal education needed to understand the text.
  
  - Score of 8: Eighth grade level
  - Score of 12: High school senior level
  - Score of 17+: College graduate level
  
  Based on sentence length and polysyllabic words.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="smog_index" type="number">
  **SMOG Index (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook)**
  
  Estimates years of education needed to understand a piece of writing.
  
  - Score of 10: Tenth grade level
  - Score of 14: Undergraduate level
  
  Particularly useful for technical writing.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="linsear_write" type="number">
  **Linsear Write Formula**
  
  Designed specifically for technical writing. Calculates grade level based on easy and hard words.
  
  - Score below 8: Easy for students
  - Score of 8-11: Medium difficulty
  - Score above 11: Difficult
</ParamField>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Basic usage
vale ls-metrics README.md
```

```bash Pretty print with jq
vale ls-metrics document.md | jq
```

```bash Extract specific metric
vale ls-metrics file.md | jq '.flesch_reading_ease'
```

```bash Check reading time
vale ls-metrics article.md | jq '.reading_time'
```

```bash Compare multiple files
for file in docs/*.md; do
  echo "$file: $(vale ls-metrics $file | jq '.words') words"
done
```
</CodeGroup>

## Use Cases

### Verify Readability Goals

Check if content meets readability targets:

```bash
FLESCH=$(vale ls-metrics document.md | jq '.flesch_reading_ease')
if (( $(echo "$FLESCH < 60" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "Warning: Text may be too difficult"
fi
```

### Track Content Complexity

Monitor documentation complexity over time:

```bash
vale ls-metrics docs/guide.md | jq '{
  words,
  flesch_reading_ease,
  reading_time
}'
```

Output:
```json
{
  "words": 1250,
  "flesch_reading_ease": 65.4,
  "reading_time": 6
}
```

### Generate Reports

Create readability reports for multiple files:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "File,Words,Flesch,Grade Level"
for file in docs/**/*.md; do
  METRICS=$(vale ls-metrics "$file")
  WORDS=$(echo $METRICS | jq '.words')
  FLESCH=$(echo $METRICS | jq '.flesch_reading_ease')
  GRADE=$(echo $METRICS | jq '.flesch_kincaid_grade_level')
  echo "$file,$WORDS,$FLESCH,$GRADE"
done
```

### CI/CD Integration

Enforce readability standards in continuous integration:

```yaml GitHub Actions
- name: Check readability
  run: |
    FLESCH=$(vale ls-metrics docs/readme.md | jq '.flesch_reading_ease')
    if (( $(echo "$FLESCH < 60" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "::error::Documentation readability score too low: $FLESCH"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## How Metrics Are Calculated

<Steps>
  <Step title="Text extraction">
    Vale processes the file using a minimal configuration that extracts plain text while respecting markup structure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tokenization">
    The text is split into paragraphs, sentences, and words using linguistic rules.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Syllable counting">
    Vale uses an algorithm to estimate syllable counts for English words.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Score computation">
    Each readability formula is applied using the gathered statistics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Metrics are calculated using a default `.txt` format configuration. For Markdown or other markup, Vale processes only the text content, excluding code blocks and similar elements.

## Understanding Readability Scores

### Target Scores by Audience

| Audience | Flesch Ease | Grade Level | Fog Index |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| General public | 60-70 | 7-8 | 8-10 |
| Technical docs | 50-60 | 9-10 | 10-12 |
| Academic | 30-50 | 13+ | 12+ |
| Marketing | 60-80 | 6-8 | 8 |

### Improving Scores

To improve readability metrics:

- **Shorten sentences** - Break complex sentences into shorter ones
- **Use simpler words** - Replace polysyllabic words with shorter alternatives
- **Reduce passive voice** - Use active constructions
- **Add paragraphs** - Break up long blocks of text
- **Vary sentence length** - Mix short and medium sentences

<Tip>
  Use the metrics as guidelines, not absolute rules. Technical documentation often requires complexity that results in lower readability scores.
</Tip>

## Limitations

- **English only** - Metrics are designed for English text and may not be accurate for other languages
- **Single file** - The command processes only one file at a time
- **Estimation** - Syllable counting and reading time are estimates
- **No context** - Metrics don't account for document purpose or audience expertise
