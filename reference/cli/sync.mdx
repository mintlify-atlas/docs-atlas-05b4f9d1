title: "vale sync"
description: "Download and install external style packages and configuration sources."
---

The `sync` command downloads and installs Vale style packages from external sources defined in your `.vale.ini` configuration file.

## Usage

```bash
vale sync
```

This command reads the `Packages` setting from your `.vale.ini` file and downloads each package to your `StylesPath` directory.

<Note>
  Run `vale sync` after adding new packages to your configuration or when setting up Vale in a new environment.
</Note>

## Configuration

Define packages in the root section of your `.vale.ini` file:

```ini .vale.ini
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion

Packages = https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.zip, \
           https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good/releases/latest/download/write-good.zip

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, Microsoft, write-good
```

<ParamField path="Packages" type="string">
  Comma-separated list of package URLs to download. Each URL should point to a `.zip` file containing a Vale style package.
  
  Packages can come from:
  - GitHub releases (most common)
  - Direct URLs to `.zip` files
  - Any HTTP/HTTPS endpoint serving Vale packages
</ParamField>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read configuration">
    Vale locates your `.vale.ini` file and parses the `Packages` list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download packages">
    Each package URL is downloaded in sequence with a progress indicator:
    
    ```
    Syncing Microsoft
    Syncing write-good
    ✔ Synced 2 package(s) to 'styles'.
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract and install">
    Each `.zip` file is extracted to your `StylesPath` directory. The package name is derived from the filename.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    After syncing, the styles are immediately available for use in your configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Custom Packages

You can host your own Vale packages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create package structure">
    Organize your style rules in a directory:
    ```
    MyStyle/
    ├── rule1.yml
    ├── rule2.yml
    └── vocabularies/
        ├── accept.txt
        └── reject.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create zip file">
    Compress the directory:
    ```bash
    zip -r MyStyle.zip MyStyle/
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Host the package">
    Upload to GitHub releases, a web server, or any accessible URL.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add to configuration">
    Reference the URL in your `.vale.ini`:
    ```ini
    Packages = https://example.com/MyStyle.zip
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
```ini Single package
StylesPath = styles
Packages = https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.zip

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Microsoft
```

```ini Multiple packages
StylesPath = styles
Packages = https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.zip, \
           https://github.com/errata-ai/Google/releases/latest/download/Google.zip, \
           https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good/releases/latest/download/write-good.zip

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Microsoft, Google, write-good
```

```ini Custom package URL
StylesPath = styles
Packages = https://my-company.com/packages/CompanyStyle.zip

[*]
BasedOnStyles = CompanyStyle
```

```ini Mixed sources
StylesPath = styles
Packages = https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.zip, \
           https://internal.company.com/vale/InternalStyle.zip

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Microsoft, InternalStyle
```
</CodeGroup>

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup

When setting up Vale in a new project:

```bash
# Create .vale.ini with desired packages
echo "StylesPath = styles
Packages = https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.zip

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Microsoft" > .vale.ini

# Download packages
vale sync

# Start linting
vale .
```

### CI/CD Integration

In continuous integration pipelines:

```yaml GitHub Actions
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  
  - name: Install Vale
    run: |
      wget https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases/latest/download/vale_Linux_64-bit.tar.gz
      tar -xzf vale_Linux_64-bit.tar.gz
      sudo mv vale /usr/local/bin/
  
  - name: Sync Vale packages
    run: vale sync
  
  - name: Run Vale
    run: vale .
```

### Update Packages

To update to the latest package versions:

```bash
# Remove existing packages
rm -rf styles/*

# Re-download
vale sync
```

<Tip>
  Using `latest` in GitHub release URLs ensures you always get the most recent package version when running `vale sync`.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Package Download Fails

If a package fails to download:

- Verify the URL is accessible in a browser
- Check network connectivity and firewall rules
- Ensure you have write permissions to the `StylesPath` directory
- Try downloading the `.zip` file manually to test

### Package Not Found After Sync

If styles aren't available after syncing:

- Verify the package extracted to the correct directory
- Check that the style name in `BasedOnStyles` matches the package directory name
- Run `vale ls-dirs` to confirm your `StylesPath` location
- Inspect the package contents to ensure it has `.yml` rule files

### Configuration Pipeline

Packages are stored in the `.vale-config` subdirectory of your `StylesPath` as part of Vale's configuration pipeline. This directory is managed automatically and shouldn't be modified manually.

<Warning>
  Don't commit the `.vale-config` directory to version control. Instead, commit your `.vale.ini` configuration and run `vale sync` to install packages.
</Warning>

## Directory Structure

After running `sync`, your project structure looks like:

```
project/
├── .vale.ini
└── styles/
    ├── .vale-config/      # Managed by sync (don't modify)
    ├── Microsoft/         # Downloaded package
    │   ├── rule1.yml
    │   └── rule2.yml
    └── write-good/        # Downloaded package
        ├── rule1.yml
        └── rule2.yml
```
