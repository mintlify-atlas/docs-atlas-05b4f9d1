---

The `readability` rule type calculates the reading grade level of text using standard readability metrics. It helps ensure content is accessible to your target audience.

## How It Works

The `readability` rule processes text through one or more readability formulas, calculates an average grade level, and triggers an alert if the grade exceeds the specified threshold.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="metrics" type="array" required>
  An array of readability metrics to calculate. Options:
  - `Gunning Fog`
  - `Coleman-Liau`
  - `Flesch-Kincaid`
  - `SMOG`
  - `Automated Readability`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="grade" type="float" required>
  The maximum acceptable grade level. Alerts trigger when the calculated grade exceeds this value.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

Use the most common readability metric:

```yaml
extends: readability
message: "Grade level (%s) too high!"
level: warning
grade: 7
metrics:
  - Flesch-Kincaid
```

### Multiple Metrics Average

Calculate an average across multiple metrics:

```yaml
extends: readability
message: "Reading grade level (%s) exceeds target (8)"
level: error
grade: 8
metrics:
  - Flesch-Kincaid
  - Gunning Fog
  - Coleman-Liau
```

### SMOG for Technical Writing

Use SMOG index for technical documentation:

```yaml
extends: readability
message: "SMOG index (%s) too high for general audience"
level: warning
grade: 10
metrics:
  - SMOG
```

### Comprehensive Check

Use all available metrics for thorough evaluation:

```yaml
extends: readability
message: "Average grade level (%s) exceeds maximum (9)"
level: error
grade: 9
metrics:
  - Gunning Fog
  - Coleman-Liau
  - Flesch-Kincaid
  - SMOG
  - Automated Readability
```

### Accessible Content

Enforce lower grade level for accessible content:

```yaml
extends: readability
message: "Content must be readable at 6th grade level (current: %s)"
level: error
grade: 6
metrics:
  - Flesch-Kincaid
  - Coleman-Liau
```

## Readability Metrics Explained

### Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
- **Formula**: `0.39 × (words / sentences) + 11.8 × (syllables / words) - 15.59`
- **Best for**: General content and documentation
- **Range**: Typically 0-18 (US grade levels)

### Gunning Fog Index
- **Formula**: `0.4 × ((words / sentences) + 100 × (complex words / words))`
- **Best for**: Business writing and journalism
- **Range**: 6+ (higher = more difficult)

### Coleman-Liau Index
- **Formula**: Based on characters per word and words per sentence
- **Best for**: Technical documentation
- **Range**: Typically 1-16 (US grade levels)

### SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook)
- **Formula**: `1.0430 × √(polysyllables × (30 / sentences)) + 3.1291`
- **Best for**: Health and medical writing
- **Range**: Typically 4-18 (US grade levels)

### Automated Readability Index
- **Formula**: `4.71 × (characters / words) + 0.5 × (words / sentences) - 21.43`
- **Best for**: Technical and instructional content
- **Range**: Typically 1-14+ (US grade levels)

## Use Cases

<Info>
The `readability` rule is ideal for:
- Ensuring content accessibility
- Meeting style guide requirements
- Targeting specific audience education levels
- Comparing content complexity across documents
- Quality control for user-facing documentation
</Info>

## Scope Behavior

<Warning>
The `readability` rule is automatically scoped to `summary`. This means:

1. It analyzes paragraph-level content (not headings or list items)
2. It requires complete sentences for accurate calculation
3. Code blocks and other non-prose elements are excluded

You cannot override this scope—readability metrics require sentence-level analysis to work correctly.
</Warning>

## Grade Level Guidelines

Common grade level targets by content type:

| Content Type | Target Grade | Metrics |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| General public | 6-8 | Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG |
| Marketing copy | 7-9 | Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog |
| Technical docs | 9-11 | Coleman-Liau, Automated Readability |
| Academic papers | 12-14 | Multiple metrics |
| Medical/Legal | 10-12 | SMOG, Flesch-Kincaid |

## Technical Details

Internally, the `readability` rule (internal/check/readability.go:43-76):

1. Creates a `Document` from the scoped text
2. Calculates each specified metric individually
3. Sums all metric scores
4. Divides by the number of metrics to get average
5. Compares average against `grade` threshold
6. If exceeded, creates an alert at line 1

The calculation code:
```go
doc := summarize.NewDocument(blk.Text)
grade := 0.0

if core.StringInSlice("SMOG", o.Metrics) {
    grade += doc.SMOG()
}
// ... other metrics ...

grade /= float64(len(o.Metrics))
```

## Alert Format

The `%s` placeholder in the message is replaced with the calculated grade level, formatted to two decimal places:

```yaml
message: "Reading grade level (%s) too high"
# Becomes: "Reading grade level (10.25) too high"
```

## Multiple Metrics Averaging

When using multiple metrics, Vale calculates each independently and averages the results. This provides a more balanced assessment:

```yaml
metrics:
  - Flesch-Kincaid  # Returns: 8.5
  - Gunning Fog     # Returns: 9.2
  - Coleman-Liau    # Returns: 7.8
# Average: (8.5 + 9.2 + 7.8) / 3 = 8.5
```

## Limitations

<Note>
Readability metrics have limitations:

- They don't understand context or meaning
- Technical jargon may inflate scores incorrectly
- Short documents may yield unreliable scores
- They assume English language conventions
- Formulas may disagree on the same text

Use multiple metrics and combine with manual review for best results.

- **occurrence**: Use to count specific elements (like long sentences)
- **sequence**: Use to detect complex sentence structures
