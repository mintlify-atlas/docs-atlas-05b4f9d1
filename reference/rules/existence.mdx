title: Existence
description: Check for the presence of specific tokens in text
---

The `existence` rule type checks for the presence of specific tokens or patterns in your text. This is one of the simplest and most commonly used rule types in Vale.

## How It Works

The `existence` rule looks for any matches of specified tokens or regular expression patterns in the provided text. When a match is found, it triggers an alert.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="tokens" type="array" required>
  An array of strings or regular expressions to match against. Each token is treated as a separate pattern to look for.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ignorecase" type="boolean" default="true">
  Makes all matches case-insensitive when set to `true`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="nonword" type="boolean" default="false">
  Removes the default word boundaries (`\b`) when set to `true`. This allows you to match tokens that are part of larger words.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="exceptions" type="array">
  An array of strings or regex patterns to be ignored. Matches that are in the exceptions list will not trigger alerts.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="vocab" type="boolean" default="true">
  If `true`, Vale will use your vocabulary files (accept.txt) as additional exceptions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="raw" type="array">
  An array of raw regex strings that will be concatenated directly into the pattern without modification.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Basic Word List

Check for overly technical acronyms that should be expanded:

```yaml
extends: existence
message: "Avoid using '%s'"
description: "Tech people know their acronyms; you come across as not very tech-savvy if you expand them."
ignorecase: true
level: warning
tokens:
  - 'cascading[ -]?style[ -]?sheets'
  - 'hyper[ -]?text([ -]?mark[ -]?up([ -]?language)?)?'
```

### E-Prime Style

Check for forms of "to be" to encourage more active writing:

```yaml
extends: existence
message: 'Avoid using "%s"'
ignorecase: true
level: suggestion
tokens:
  - am
  - are
  - aren't
  - be
  - been
  - being
  - is
  - isn't
  - was
  - wasn't
  - were
  - weren't
```

### Using Exceptions

Check for problematic terms while allowing specific exceptions:

```yaml
extends: existence
message: "Consider using '%s' instead of '%s'."
level: warning
ignorecase: false
tokens:
  - blacklist
  - whitelist
  - master
  - slave
exceptions:
  - Master's degree
  - masterpiece
```

### Pattern Matching with Nonword

Match patterns that aren't complete words:

```yaml
extends: existence
message: "Don't use trailing punctuation in headings."
level: error
scope: heading
nonword: true
tokens:
  - '[a-z][.?!:,;]$'
```

## Use Cases

<Info>
The `existence` rule is ideal for:
- Maintaining word blocklists
- Enforcing style guidelines about specific terms
- Preventing deprecated terminology
- Checking for brand name misuse
- Enforcing inclusive language

## Technical Details

Internally, the `existence` rule (internal/check/existence.go:73-97):

1. Compiles all tokens into a single regular expression pattern
2. Searches the text for all matches using `FindAllStringIndex`
3. For each match, checks if it's in the exceptions list
4. Creates an alert for any match that's not an exception

The pattern compilation respects the `ignorecase` and `nonword` settings, automatically adding word boundaries unless `nonword` is `true`.

- **substitution**: Use when you want to suggest replacements for matched tokens
- **occurrence**: Use when you want to count how many times a token appears
- **repetition**: Use when you want to detect repeated words
