description: "How Vale organizes and extends rules through style-based architecture"
---

Vale uses a style-based architecture to organize rules (also called "checks"). A style is a collection of individual rules stored as YAML files, allowing you to maintain reusable rule sets for different writing standards.

## What is a style?

A style is a directory containing one or more rule files. Each rule file defines a single check that Vale applies to your content. For example:

```
MyStyle/
├── Headings.yml
├── Terms.yml
└── Spelling.yml
```

You can create custom styles or use pre-built ones from the [Vale package hub](https://vale.sh/hub). Popular styles include Microsoft, Google, write-good, and proselint.

## Extension points

Vale provides 12 extension points that define how rules match and evaluate text. Each rule file must declare which extension point it uses via the `extends` key.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="existence">
    Checks for the presence of specific words or patterns.

    ```yaml
    extends: existence
    message: "Avoid using '%s'"
    level: error
    tokens:
      - obviously
      - simply
      - just
    ```

    Use `existence` when you want to flag specific terms, phrases, or patterns. The rule triggers whenever any token is found in the text.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `tokens`: List of terms to search for
    - `ignorecase`: Whether to ignore case (default: true)
    - `nonword`: Match anywhere, not just word boundaries
    - `exceptions`: Terms to ignore even if they match
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="substitution">
    Suggests replacements for matched text.

    ```yaml
    extends: substitution
    message: "Use '%s' instead of '%s'"
    level: warning
    swap:
      utilize: use
      leverage: use
      prior to: before
    ```

    The `substitution` extension swaps keys for values, finding the key pattern and suggesting the value as a replacement.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `swap`: Map of patterns to replacements
    - `ignorecase`: Whether to ignore case
    - `capitalize`: Preserve original capitalization
    - `nonword`: Match anywhere in text
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="occurrence">
    Counts occurrences of a token against min/max thresholds.

    ```yaml
    extends: occurrence
    message: "More than 3 commas in a sentence"
    level: suggestion
    scope: sentence
    token: ','
    max: 3
    ```

    Use `occurrence` to enforce limits on repetitive elements like commas, exclamation points, or word counts.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `token`: Regular expression to match
    - `max`: Maximum allowed occurrences
    - `min`: Minimum required occurrences
    - `scope`: Where to apply the count
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="repetition">
    Detects repeated words or phrases.

    ```yaml
    extends: repetition
    message: "'%s' is repeated"
    level: error
    ignorecase: true
    alpha: true
    tokens:
      - '[^\s]+'
    ```

    The `repetition` extension finds consecutive duplicate tokens, useful for catching unintentional word repetition.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `tokens`: Patterns defining what counts as a token
    - `alpha`: Only check alphabetic tokens
    - `ignorecase`: Whether to ignore case
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="consistency">
    Enforces consistent usage between variants.

    ```yaml
    extends: consistency
    message: "Inconsistent spelling of '%s'"
    level: error
    either:
      center: centre
      color: colour
      analyze: analyse
    ```

    Use `consistency` when either variant is acceptable, but you want consistent usage throughout a document.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `either`: Map of variant pairs
    - `ignorecase`: Whether to ignore case
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="conditional">
    Ensures one pattern implies another.

    ```yaml
    extends: conditional
    message: "'%s' has no definition"
    level: error
    first: '\b([A-Z]{3,5})\b'
    second: '([A-Z]{3,5}): (?:\b[A-Z][a-z]+ )+'
    exceptions:
      - API
      - HTTP
    ```

    The `conditional` extension ensures that using an abbreviation (first) requires a definition (second) somewhere in the file.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `first`: The trigger pattern (antecedent)
    - `second`: The required pattern (consequent)
    - `exceptions`: Patterns to exclude
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="capitalization">
    Checks capitalization style.

    ```yaml
    extends: capitalization
    message: "'%s' should be in title case"
    level: warning
    match: $title
    style: AP
    exceptions:
      - API
      - GitHub
    ```

    The `capitalization` extension supports multiple styles:
    - `$title`: Title case (AP or Chicago style)
    - `$sentence`: Sentence case
    - `$lower`: All lowercase
    - `$upper`: All uppercase

    **Key attributes:**
    - `match`: Capitalization pattern to check
    - `style`: "AP" or "Chicago" (for title case)
    - `exceptions`: Terms to ignore
    - `threshold`: Proportion of words that must match (0-1)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="readability">
    Calculates readability scores.

    ```yaml
    extends: readability
    message: "Grade level (%s) too high"
    level: warning
    grade: 8
    metrics:
      - Flesch-Kincaid
      - Gunning Fog
    ```

    The `readability` extension evaluates text complexity using established readability formulas.

    **Available metrics:**
    - Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
    - Gunning Fog Index
    - Coleman-Liau Index
    - Automated Readability Index
    - SMOG
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="spelling">
    Checks spelling against dictionaries.

    ```yaml
    extends: spelling
    message: "'%s' is misspelled"
    level: error
    dictionaries:
      - en_US
    ignore:
      - custom-terms.txt
    ```

    The `spelling` extension integrates with Hunspell dictionaries and supports custom word lists.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `dictionaries`: Dictionary names to use
    - `ignore`: Files containing terms to ignore
    - `filters`: Regular expressions to skip
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="sequence">
    Matches sequences of parts-of-speech.

    ```yaml
    extends: sequence
    message: "Use 'by using' instead of '%s'"
    level: warning
    tokens:
      - tag: NN
      - pattern: using
    ```

    The `sequence` extension uses part-of-speech tagging to match grammatical patterns.

    **Key attributes:**
    - `tokens`: List of token definitions
    - `tag`: POS tag to match (NN, VB, JJ, etc.)
    - `pattern`: Exact text pattern
    - `skip`: Number of tokens to skip
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="metric">
    Evaluates custom formulas.

    ```yaml
    extends: metric
    message: "This section has %s H2 headings"
    formula: heading.h2
    condition: "> 5"
    ```

    The `metric` extension lets you create custom formulas using document statistics like word count, sentence count, and heading counts.

    **Available variables:**
    - `words`, `sentences`, `paragraphs`
    - `characters`, `syllables`, `complex_words`
    - `heading.h1` through `heading.h6`
    - `list`, `blockquote`, `pre`

    Example formula:
    ```yaml
    formula: |
      (0.39 * (words / sentences)) + (11.8 * (syllables / words)) - 15.59
    condition: "> 8"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="script">
    Runs custom Tengo scripts.

    ```yaml
    extends: script
    message: "Too many paragraphs per section"
    scope: raw
    script: |
      text := import("text")
      matches := []

      count := 0
      for line in text.split(scope, "\n") {
        if text.has_prefix(line, "#") {
          count = 0
        } else if count > 3 {
          start := text.index(scope, line)
          matches = append(matches, {begin: start, end: start + len(line)})
          count = 0
        } else if text.trim_space(line) == "" {
          count += 1
        }
      }
    ```

    The `script` extension provides maximum flexibility for complex logic using the [Tengo scripting language](https://github.com/d5/tengo).

    **Key attributes:**
    - `script`: Inline Tengo code or file path
    - `scope`: Usually `raw` to access markup
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Rule definition structure

Every rule file follows this basic structure:

```yaml
extends: existence
message: "Consider removing '%s'"
description: "Optional longer explanation"
level: warning
link: https://example.com/style-guide
scope: text
action:
  name: remove
```

<Accordion title="Required fields">
  - `extends`: The extension point (one of the 12 types)
  - `message`: The alert message shown to users
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Optional fields">
  - `description`: Extended explanation of the rule
  - `level`: Severity level (suggestion, warning, or error)
  - `link`: URL to style guide or documentation
  - `scope`: Where the rule applies (see [Scoping](/concepts/scoping))
  - `action`: Automated fix definition
  - `limit`: Maximum number of alerts per file
</Accordion>

## Built-in styles

Vale includes a minimal built-in style called "Vale" with four rules:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vale.Avoid">
    An `existence` rule with an empty token list. You can customize this via your vocabulary.
    
    ```yaml
    extends: existence
    message: "Avoid using '%s'"
    level: error
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vale.Terms">
    A `substitution` rule for term consistency, integrated with vocabularies.
    
    ```yaml
    extends: substitution
    message: "Use '%s' instead of '%s'"
    level: error
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vale.Repetition">
    A `repetition` rule that catches repeated words.
    
    ```yaml
    extends: repetition
    message: "'%s' is repeated!"
    level: error
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vale.Spelling">
    A `spelling` rule that integrates with your vocabularies.
    
    ```yaml
    extends: spelling
    message: "Did you really mean '%s'?"
    level: error
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using multiple styles

You can apply multiple styles to your content by listing them in your configuration:

```ini
[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, Google, Microsoft
```

Vale loads rules from all specified styles and applies them in order. If rules conflict, the last style's rules take precedence.

## Style loading order

Vale searches for styles in this order:

1. The `StylesPath` directory specified in `.vale.ini`
2. The global styles directory (when using `vale sync`)
3. Built-in styles
